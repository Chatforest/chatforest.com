card_description: "CrewAI (50.6K stars, MIT, Python, v1.14.4) is the most-starred Python agent framework on GitHub and arguably the one that popularized the idea of assigning agents distinct roles, goals, and backstories. The framework centers on two abstractions: Crews (collaborative groups of role-playing agents that tackle tasks via sequential or hierarchical coordination) and Flows (event-driven workflow orchestration with @start, @listen, and @router decorators and Pydantic-backed state management). Memory uses LanceDB locally, with LLM-assisted scope inference and automatic deduplication. The tools ecosystem includes 30+ built-in integrations (web search, PDF, GitHub, database, code execution) plus custom tools via @tool decorator. MCP client support is solid: MCPServerAdapter in crewai-tools connects agents to any MCP server over stdio, SSE, or Streamable HTTP, with automatic tool discovery and server-name prefixing to prevent collisions. MCP server capability (exposing CrewAI agents as MCP endpoints) requires CrewAI's enterprise platform. Main limitations: Python-only, no OSS MCP server, versioning jumps can confuse (v1.14.x while still adding major features). Part of our **Developer Tools** category. Rating: 4.5/5."

Before LangGraph, before Agno, before mcp-agent — most Python developers learning about AI agents encountered the idea of role-based agent teams through CrewAI. At **50,652 stars** and v1.14.4 (released April 30, 2026), it remains the most-starred Python agent framework on GitHub by a significant margin, and for good reason: its role/goal/backstory model for defining agents maps cleanly onto how people naturally think about dividing work.

This is a framework that shaped vocabulary. When you read about "agent crews" or "agent roles" in a blog post or conference talk, you are usually reading about patterns CrewAI introduced. Part of our **[Developer Tools category](/categories/developer-tools/)**.

## What It Does

CrewAI is a Python framework for building multi-agent systems. The core insight was that agents become dramatically more capable when given a specific **role**, a clear **goal**, and a **backstory** that shapes how they reason. Rather than calling a general-purpose LLM repeatedly, you define specialized agents — a Senior Researcher, a Market Analyst, a Technical Writer — and let them work together on tasks that match their expertise.

The framework now organizes around two complementary abstractions:

### Crews

A **Crew** is a collaborative group of agents working on a shared objective. Agents are defined with roles, goals, and backstories, then assigned Tasks with specific instructions and expected outputs. The Crew manages execution and coordination.

Two process types control how tasks flow:

- **Sequential** (default) — tasks execute one at a time in order, with each task's output available as context for the next. Simple, predictable, good for most pipelines.
- **Hierarchical** — a manager agent (powered by its own LLM) receives the objective, breaks it into subtasks, delegates to specialized agents, and validates results before proceeding. Useful when the task decomposition itself requires intelligence.

The output of a Crew run is a structured `CrewOutput` containing raw text, JSON, or Pydantic model results, plus token usage metrics.

### Flows

**Flows** are event-driven workflow orchestration built on a decorator pattern:

- `@start()` — marks one or more entry points
- `@listen(method)` — executes when a specified method completes, receiving its output
- `@router()` — returns a route label for conditional branching

State management supports two modes: unstructured (dict-like, flexible) or structured (Pydantic `BaseModel`, type-safe). Both modes automatically assign a UUID to each execution for tracking.

The `@human_feedback` decorator pauses a Flow to collect human input — useful for approval gates, quality checks, and human-in-the-loop pipelines.

Flows and Crews compose together: a Flow can orchestrate multiple Crews as steps, delegating complex multi-agent work to a Crew while maintaining overall state and routing logic at the Flow level.

## MCP Support

### As an MCP Client

CrewAI's MCP client support lives in `crewai-tools` via the `MCPServerAdapter` class. It connects any agent to any external MCP server and surfaces the server's tools as native CrewAI tools.

Three transports are supported:

- **Stdio** — for local MCP servers running as subprocess
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** — for remote servers with streaming output
- **Streamable HTTP** — for flexible remote connections, supports bidirectional communication

Tools are automatically discovered and integrated on connection. To prevent name collisions when connecting to multiple servers, tool names are prefixed with the server name.

```python
from crewai import Agent
from crewai_tools import MCPServerAdapter
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="python3",
    args=["servers/your_mcp_server.py"],
)

with MCPServerAdapter(server_params) as mcp_tools:
    analyst = Agent(
        role="Data Analyst",
        goal="Analyze data using MCP-connected tools",
        backstory="Expert analyst with access to specialized data tools",
        tools=mcp_tools,
    )
```

The adapter uses Python context managers to handle connection lifecycle — startup, tool discovery, and teardown are automatic.

One notable limitation: MCPServerAdapter adapts MCP **tools** only. Other MCP primitives (prompts, resources) are not surfaced as CrewAI components. Complex multi-modal tool outputs may also require custom handling beyond the standard text response pattern.

### As an MCP Server

Exposing CrewAI agents as an MCP server endpoint — so that Cursor, Claude Desktop, or other MCP clients can call them — requires **CrewAI's enterprise platform (CrewAI AMP)**. This capability is documented in the enterprise guides but is not available in the open-source package. For teams that need bidirectional MCP in OSS Python, Agno's AgentOS is the closest alternative.

## Memory

CrewAI's memory system uses **LanceDB** as the local storage backend, with an LLM-assisted layer that analyzes content on save. Rather than requiring you to categorize memories manually, the framework infers scope (path-like structures such as `/agent/researcher` or `/project/analysis`), importance, and categories automatically.

Retrieval uses composite scoring: semantic similarity, recency, and importance are blended to surface the most relevant memories. Deep recall mode runs multi-step LLM query refinement for harder lookups.

The system also deduplicates: before saving, it checks for similar existing records and consolidates redundant entries. Records persist across sessions in a local `.crewai/memory` directory (or a configured custom path). Custom storage backends are supported via the `StorageBackend` protocol.

---

## Tools Ecosystem

CrewAI ships 30+ built-in tools as part of `crewai-tools`:

- **Data retrieval**: `FileReadTool`, `DirectoryReadTool`, `PDFSearchTool`
- **Web operations**: `WebsiteSearchTool`, `ScrapeWebsiteTool`, `FirecrawlScrapeWebsiteTool`
- **Specialized search**: `GithubSearchTool`, `YoutubeVideoSearchTool`, `CodeDocsSearchTool`
- **Code execution**: `CodeInterpreterTool`
- **Image generation**: DALL-E integration
- **Database**: `PGSearchTool`

Custom tools use either a `@tool` decorator (fastest) or subclassing `BaseTool` with a Pydantic schema and `_run()` method (more control). Both support async via `async def` and include built-in error handling and intelligent caching.

## What Works Well

- **50,600+ stars** — the most-starred Python agent framework on GitHub; large, active community, extensive tutorials and examples
- **MIT license** — no copyleft obligations; use commercially without source disclosure requirements
- **Crews + Flows** — the dual abstraction covers both collaborative team intelligence and precise procedural control; they compose naturally
- **Human-in-the-loop** — `@human_feedback` is baked in as a first-class Flow feature, not an afterthought
- **Role-based agents** — the role/goal/backstory mental model is intuitive and maps well onto real organizational structures
- **30+ built-in tools** — broad coverage out of the box; most research/analysis/scraping use cases covered without custom tools
- **Active maintenance** — v1.14.4 released April 30, 2026; pre-release v1.14.5a2 followed May 4, 2026

## Limitations

- **Python-only** — no TypeScript/JavaScript support; teams building Node.js applications need Mastra or a different framework
- **No OSS MCP server** — exposing CrewAI agents as an MCP endpoint requires the enterprise cloud platform; the OSS package is MCP client only
- **Version numbering** — v1.14.x is mature software, but the minor version has been incrementing rapidly with significant feature additions; release notes require attention
- **Hierarchical complexity** — manager-agent coordination is powerful but introduces failure modes that are harder to debug than sequential failures; the manager LLM's judgment affects the whole crew
- **Memory LLM cost** — the memory system uses an LLM to analyze and categorize saves; in high-volume applications this adds token cost that may not be immediately visible

## Who Should Use CrewAI

CrewAI fits teams that:

- Want the largest Python agent community and the most tutorials, examples, and Stack Overflow answers
- Are building collaborative agent systems where the role/goal/backstory model maps onto their use case
- Need a mature, MIT-licensed framework with active maintenance
- Want MCP client support (connecting to external MCP servers) without needing to expose agents as an MCP server themselves

It is less suited for TypeScript shops, teams that need OSS bidirectional MCP (consider Agno or Mastra), or projects that want a minimal library without a cloud enterprise companion product.

## Rating: 4.5 / 5

CrewAI's star count reflects genuine community value: the framework works, the mental model is intuitive, and the Crews + Flows dual abstraction covers most multi-agent use cases without forcing you into one paradigm. The MIT license is the most permissive of any framework reviewed here. What holds it back from a higher score is the MCP server gap in OSS — at 50,000 stars, it should not require an enterprise subscription to expose agents as MCP endpoints — and the Python-only constraint.

If you are building Python agent systems and want the most community support, tutorials, and integrations available, CrewAI is the obvious starting point.
