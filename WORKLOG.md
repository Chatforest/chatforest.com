## Run 29 — 2026-03-14 — Traffic & Promotion Strategy + Schema.org SEO

**Mode:** Researcher + Strategist + Developer

### Inbox update
- **High-priority message from Rob + Boss Claude** (message #88): Asked for a traffic/promotion plan — where to post content, social media strategy, open-source Reddit alternatives, what's needed to execute.
- Replied with full plan summary (message #89).

### What I did

1. **Researched traffic/promotion strategies** — web searches on:
   - Developer content promotion tactics for 2026
   - MCP community platforms and developer channels
   - Open-source Reddit alternatives (Lemmy, Kbin, Tildes)
   - SEO timeline expectations for new technical sites
   - Hacker News submission best practices
   - Dev.to/Hashnode cross-posting strategies

2. **Wrote comprehensive traffic & promotion plan** — `strategy/02-traffic-promotion-plan.md`
   - **Three channels:** Community posting (immediate), SEO optimization (medium-term), newsletter (long-term)
   - **Community targets:** Reddit (r/mcp, r/ClaudeAI, r/LocalLLaMA), Hacker News, Dev.to, Hashnode, Lemmy/Fediverse
   - **Posting approach:** Genuine technical contributions, not link-dropping. Lead with insights, link to reviews in context.
   - **SEO needs:** Google Search Console, Schema.org structured data, backlink building
   - **What I need from Rob:** Reddit account (Tier 3), Google Search Console verification, Dev.to account, OK on transparent AI identity
   - **Execution priority table** with 8 ranked actions
   - **Key principle:** Transparent about being AI-operated on all platforms

3. **Added Schema.org structured data to all pages** — developer work, no accounts needed
   - Reviews get `Review` + `SoftwareApplication` schema (helps rich results in search)
   - Guides/comparisons get `Article` schema
   - Homepage gets `WebSite` schema
   - Created reusable Hugo partials: `schema-review.html`, `schema-article.html`
   - Used Hugo's `dict` + `jsonify` + `safeJS` pipeline for clean JSON-LD output
   - All 25 content pages + homepage now have structured data

4. **Deployed to chatforest.com** — all pages updated with Schema.org markup

### What should happen next
- **Run 30:** While waiting for Rob's reply on the promotion plan, write another review or comparison.
- **Run 31+:** Execute promotion plan once Rob approves accounts, update mega-comparison with Notion
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate links

## Run 30 — 2026-03-14 — Content (Best Productivity & Knowledge Management MCP Servers Comparison)

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- Pending message #89 (from me, re: traffic/promotion plan) still unanswered. No new messages from Rob.

### What I did

1. **Wrote "Best Productivity & Knowledge Management MCP Servers in 2026"** — `content/guides/best-productivity-mcp-servers.md`
   - **8th comparison article** — completes coverage of all major MCP server categories (browser, database, web scraping, memory, search, documentation, productivity, plus mega-comparison)
   - Head-to-head comparison of 8 servers: Notion (3.5/5), Linear, Todoist, Asana, Google Calendar, Obsidian, Slack (4/5), Google Workspace
   - Researched current state of each: Linear's Feb 2026 PM tools expansion, Todoist's MCP Apps feature, Asana V2 migration, Google Calendar community server, Obsidian's fragmented ecosystem
   - Identified three architectural patterns: first-party hosted (Notion/Linear/Todoist/Asana/Slack), community local (Google Calendar/Google Workspace), local knowledge (Obsidian)
   - Feature comparison table, decision flowchart by use case, recommended stack
   - Key insight: Google has no official MCP server for any product — the biggest gap in the productivity MCP space
   - Cross-links to our Notion and Slack reviews

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Productivity & knowledge management" section with all server recommendations
   - Added productivity rows to summary table (Notion 3.5/5 for knowledge, Linear for tasks)
   - Updated Notion from "not yet reviewed" to reviewed with full section
   - Removed Notion and Linear from "servers we haven't reviewed" section
   - Updated review count to 15, comparison count to 8
   - Added Notion to rating distribution table (3.5/5 cluster now has 5 servers)

3. **Deploy failed** — SSH to chatforest.com returned "Network is unreachable." Likely a network issue on the build server or DreamHost side. Content is committed and ready to deploy next run.

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (network issue)
- 25 content pieces: 15 reviews + 2 guides + 8 comparisons
- Content types: reviews, tutorials, explainers, comparisons, mega-comparison
- Comparison articles now cover ALL major categories: browser automation, databases, web scraping, memory/knowledge, search, documentation, productivity/knowledge management, plus mega-comparison
- SEO infrastructure up to date

### What should happen next
- **Run 31:** Deploy (retry rsync). Handle inbox messages. Write another review.
- **Run 32+:** Favicon (waiting for Rob), execute promotion plan when Rob replies
- **Future:** Newsletter setup, affiliate link integration
