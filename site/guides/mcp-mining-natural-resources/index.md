# MCP and Mining: How AI Agents Connect to Geological Modeling, Mine Planning, Resource Estimation, Environmental Monitoring, Oil & Gas, and Commodity Trading Tools

> A comprehensive guide to 100+ MCP integrations for mining and natural resources — covering geospatial/GIS tools (QGIS 901 stars, ArcGIS, GDAL 64 stars), geological survey data


Mining is one of the most data-intensive industries on earth. A single mine generates terabytes of geological survey data, drill-hole logs, grade control models, fleet telemetry, environmental sensor readings, commodity price feeds, and regulatory compliance reports — each stored in specialized software that rarely talks to the others. The global AI-in-mining market reached approximately $35.47 billion in 2025, growing at 41.92% annually toward a projected $828.33 billion by 2034. Asia-Pacific leads with a 40% market share, driven by China's smart coal mine investments and Australia's autonomous extraction leadership, while North America is the fastest-growing region as critical mineral demand surges.

MCP — the Model Context Protocol — provides a standardized way for AI agents to connect to mining's fragmented data ecosystem. Rather than building custom integrations for each geological database, fleet management system, or environmental sensor network, MCP-connected agents can query spatial data, analyze drill-hole results, monitor equipment telemetry, track commodity prices, and generate compliance reports through defined tool interfaces. The protocol transforms AI assistants from isolated chatbots into operational mining intelligence tools that work across the entire mine lifecycle — from exploration and resource estimation through extraction, processing, and environmental remediation. For an introduction to MCP itself, see our [introduction to MCP](/guides/what-is-mcp/).

The mining MCP ecosystem is maturing. As of April 2026, Seequent — the company behind Leapfrog Geo and Oasis montaj — has released the first MCP server from a major mining software vendor (Evo MCP, early development). Other mining software vendors (Deswik, Maptek, Hexagon, Datamine) have not yet released dedicated MCP servers, but the adjacent tooling — geospatial analysis (including Microsoft's Earth Copilot with 130+ satellite collections), industrial IoT, environmental monitoring, commodity pricing, and scientific databases — is increasingly rich, and these components can be assembled into powerful mining AI workflows.

This guide is research-based. We survey what MCP servers exist across the mining and natural resources landscape, analyze the architecture patterns they enable, and identify where significant gaps remain. We do not claim to have tested or used any of these servers hands-on — our analysis draws on published documentation, open-source repositories, vendor announcements, and industry research.

## Why Mining Needs MCP

Mining workflows present integration challenges that MCP is architecturally well-suited to address.

**Geological data is inherently spatial and multi-dimensional.** Drill-hole databases, block models, geological surfaces, and grade estimates all live in specialized formats (CSV, OMF, GOCAD, Vulcan block models) across different software platforms. An MCP-connected AI agent that can read across GIS platforms, geological databases, and spatial analysis tools could automate the tedious process of correlating data across these systems.

**Mine operations generate continuous telemetry.** Autonomous haul trucks, conveyors, crushers, processing plants, and environmental sensors produce real-time data streams. SCADA systems and IoT platforms capture this data but rarely expose it in formats accessible to AI agents. MCP servers bridging industrial IoT platforms let AI agents monitor operations, detect anomalies, and recommend optimizations.

**Commodity markets drive every mining decision.** Whether to develop a deposit, expand production, or shut down operations depends on metal and energy prices that fluctuate continuously. AI agents with MCP access to commodity price feeds can integrate market intelligence into operational decisions — adjusting cut-off grades, blending strategies, or production schedules based on real-time prices.

**Environmental compliance is non-negotiable and growing.** The global ESG compliance market for mining reached $4.53 billion in 2024, growing at 8.9% CAGR to $9.55 billion by 2033. IFRS S1/S2 mandatory climate disclosures started in 2025, CSRD is live in the EU, and GRI 14: Mining Sector 2024 takes effect globally from 2026. AI agents that can pull environmental monitoring data, generate compliance reports, and track regulatory requirements across jurisdictions could transform how mines manage their ESG obligations.

**Autonomous operations are already reality.** Rio Tinto's AutoHaul runs the world's first fully autonomous long-distance heavy-haul rail network across 1,700 kilometers of track. BHP and Rio Tinto have expanded fleets of AI-driven autonomous haul trucks using LiDAR-based path planning. Digital twins like Anglo American's Quellaveco mine in Peru optimize water usage and predict operational bottlenecks. MCP provides the integration layer these autonomous systems need to coordinate with planning, scheduling, and compliance workflows.

## Geospatial and GIS MCP Servers

## Regulatory and Safety Considerations

Mining AI deployments face unique regulatory requirements that differ significantly from other industries.

**Mining-specific safety regulations.** Most jurisdictions require that safety-critical decisions in mining be made or approved by qualified mining engineers or geotechnical engineers. AI agents should assist with analysis and recommendations but should not autonomously make decisions about blast patterns, ground support, ventilation design, or dam stability without human expert review. MSHA (US), WHS (Australia), and equivalent regulators in other jurisdictions mandate human accountability for safety decisions.

**Resource estimation standards.** JORC (Australasia), NI 43-101 (Canada), SAMREC (South Africa), and CIM (Canada) codes define how mineral resources and reserves must be estimated and reported. AI agents can assist with data analysis and modeling, but a Competent Person (JORC) or Qualified Person (NI 43-101) must sign off on resource estimates. GRI 14: Mining Sector 2024, which takes effect globally from 2026, adds further disclosure requirements around mineral resources and reserves.

**Environmental permit conditions.** Mining permits typically specify exact monitoring parameters, sampling frequencies, reporting formats, and exceedance thresholds. AI agents processing environmental data must be configured to match these precise requirements — a reading that's 0.01 mg/L over a discharge limit can trigger regulatory action, so approximate analysis is insufficient.

**ESG reporting frameworks.** IFRS S1/S2 mandatory climate disclosures (from 2025), CSRD with ESRS reporting (live in EU), and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) all require specific data collection, analysis, and reporting formats. AI agents can automate data collection and report drafting, but disclosures must be reviewed by qualified personnel and may require limited assurance from auditors.

**Data sovereignty and Indigenous rights.** Mining often occurs on or near Indigenous lands. Cultural heritage data, sacred site locations, and traditional knowledge may be subject to data sovereignty requirements that restrict how information can be stored, processed, and shared. AI agents must be configured to respect these boundaries — some geological or cultural data should never leave specific jurisdictions or systems.

**Autonomous equipment regulations.** While autonomous haul trucks and trains are operational, most jurisdictions require safety management plans, risk assessments, and defined exclusion zones. AI agents coordinating with autonomous equipment must operate within these regulatory frameworks and maintain audit trails of all decisions that affect equipment movement or safety zones.

## Current Ecosystem Gaps

The mining MCP ecosystem has significant gaps, though Seequent's Evo MCP server (see above) marks the first major vendor entry. Many opportunities remain for developers.

**Mine planning software integration.** No MCP servers exist for any major mine planning platform. Deswik, Hexagon MinePlan, Datamine, Maptek Vulcan, and Micromine all have APIs or scripting interfaces that could be exposed through MCP. This is the highest-value gap in the ecosystem — mine planning is where the most consequential decisions are made, and AI assistance could significantly improve scheduling optimization, grade control, and production forecasting. Seequent's announced partnership with Deswik for data flow between geological models and mine planning may eventually bring MCP connectivity to this space.

**Geological modeling tools.** Seequent's Evo MCP server provides early access to workspace and data management features, but does not yet expose Leapfrog Geo's core implicit modeling capabilities (surface generation, block modeling, grade estimation) through MCP. The gap has narrowed — AI agents can now interact with Seequent's geoscience data platform — but direct AI-driven geological modeling via MCP remains out of reach. GemPy (open-source 3D geological modeling in Python) remains the most MCP-ready option for actual modeling operations — its Python API could be wrapped as an MCP server relatively easily.

**Drill-hole database management.** acQuire and Fusion (Seequent) are the primary drill-hole data management systems in mining. Seequent's Evo MCP server provides some access to downhole collections and intervals, but purpose-built drill-hole database MCP servers with support for full assay querying, QAQC workflows, and compositing do not yet exist. These databases are the foundation of mineral exploration and resource estimation — deeper MCP access would enable AI agents to analyze assay results, correlate geological units, and identify exploration targets.

**Fleet management systems.** Caterpillar MineStar, Wenco FMS, Modular Mining DISPATCH, and Hexagon MineOperate all manage haul truck fleets but lack MCP servers. Fleet optimization is a high-value use case where AI agents could improve truck dispatch, reduce fuel consumption, and minimize equipment idle time.

**Tailings dam monitoring.** Given the catastrophic consequences of tailings dam failures (Brumadinho, Samarco, Mount Polley), real-time monitoring of tailings facilities is critical. While IoT MCP servers can bridge sensor data, no mining-specific tailings monitoring MCP server exists that understands piezometer readings, inclinometer data, seepage flow rates, and dam stability calculations.

**Mineral processing and metallurgy.** Concentrator plants, heap leach operations, and smelters generate extensive process data but have no MCP coverage. Digital twin platforms like Metso's Geminex (used at Newmont's Lihir mine) could benefit from MCP interfaces for AI-driven process optimization.

**Mine closure and rehabilitation.** Mine closure planning, progressive rehabilitation, and post-closure monitoring represent a growing regulatory focus but have no dedicated MCP tooling. AI agents could help track rehabilitation progress against closure plans, estimate closure liabilities, and monitor post-closure environmental performance.

## Getting Started by Role

### Exploration Geologist
Start with the **QGIS MCP server** (901 stars) and **NASA Earthdata MCP** for satellite-based mineral mapping. Use **PostGIS MCP** to query drill-hole databases spatially. Add **GIS MCP** for spatial correlation analysis between geological, geochemical, and geophysical datasets.

### Mine Engineer
Focus on **IoT-Edge MCP Server** for equipment telemetry and **AWS IoT SiteWise MCP** for asset monitoring. Use **Weather MCP** for operational weather planning. The gap you'll feel most is the lack of mine planning software MCP servers — for now, consider wrapping your planning tool's Python API as a custom MCP server.

### Environmental Manager
Combine **IoT-Edge MCP** for environmental sensor data with **Weather MCP** for meteorological context and **QGIS MCP** for spatial compliance mapping. Use these to automate monitoring report generation and exceedance alerting. The ESG reporting gap is significant — you'll likely need custom tooling to map sensor data to IFRS S2 and GRI 14 disclosure formats.

### Commodity Analyst
Use **OilPriceAPI MCP** for energy commodities and **Metal Price MCP** for precious metals. Combine with financial MCP servers from the broader ecosystem for market analysis. The gap is in base metals pricing (copper, iron ore, lithium, nickel) — no MCP server yet covers these directly, though OilPriceAPI covers 40+ commodities.

### Mine Manager
You need the full stack: **IoT-Edge MCP** for operations, **Weather MCP** for planning, **commodity price servers** for economics, and **QGIS/PostGIS** for spatial context. Start with the operations monitor pattern — getting real-time equipment and environmental data into AI workflows provides the fastest operational value.

### Mining Software Developer
The biggest opportunity is building MCP servers for mining-specific platforms. Start with whichever platform your organization uses — Deswik, Maptek, Hexagon, or open-source alternatives. Wrap existing APIs or scripting interfaces as MCP tools. Even a read-only MCP server for a block model database would be valuable to the community.
